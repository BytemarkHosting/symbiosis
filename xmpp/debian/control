Description: Add XMPP (Jabber) support to Symbiosis
 This package installs prosody and configures users based on existing 
 symbiosis-email accounts, such that all email users can optionally use XMPP 
 with their handle being the same as their email address. Prosody is 
 configured to authenticate against the Dovecot authentication mechanism.
