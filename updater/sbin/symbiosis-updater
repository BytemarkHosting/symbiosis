=head1 ABOUT

This script is designed to run non-interactively and apply any pending
security and system package updates, using the Debian apt-get system.

The script will read a special sources list file which will contain
references to repositories which may be upgraded.

By default the script will archive the results of its upgrades.

=cut

=head1 DISABLING

To disable the updater please run the following command:

=for example begin

echo "DISABLED=1" >> /etc/symbiosis/updater.d/config

=for example end

This will ensure the updater exits.

=cut

=head1 FILES

The system will invoke B<apt-get> against the file
B</etc/apt/sources.list.security> and archive the results of any updates
applied to the directory B</var/log/symbiosis-updater/>
