# Overview
# --------
#
# This script is designed to determine the name of any remote
# backup space associated with this machine and upload the local
# archive, produced by backup2l, to this location.
#
#
# Override
# --------
#
# If there is a file "/etc/symbiosis/dns.d/backup.name" it
# is assumed to contain the name and path of a remote location to
# use for the rsync upload.
#
#
# Disabling
# ---------
#
# To disable uploads completely create the empty file named
# "/etc/symbiosis/dns.d/backup.name".
