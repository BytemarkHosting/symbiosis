/**
 * This single header-file is the source of the string-manipulation
 * which is performed by the mod_vhost_bytemark module.
 *
 * The intention is that this code will map between a hostname
 * and a directory.
 *
 * Request for www.example.com  -> /srv/example.com/public/htdocs
 * Request for test.example.com -> /srv/example.com/public/htdocs
 * Request for example.com      -> /srv/example.com/public/htdocs
 *
 * In short if a request for a file doesn't exist we'll remove sections of
 * the requested hostname until we find a directory which exists.
 *
 * This code is only invoked in a situation where a 404 would have
 * resulted anyway so if it fails it fails.
