# Google apply super-strict criteria to machines sending mail over IPv6.  Hosts
# must have accurate reverse DNS, as well as pass either a DKIM or SPF check.
# Since it is not easy to set up either SPF or DKIM in the Squeeze version of
# Symbiosis, we just restrict relaying to IPv4 by forcing DNS lookups of MX
# records in the google namespace to be IPv4 only.
# 
# See https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126#authentication for Google's
# mean policy to IPv6 adopters.
