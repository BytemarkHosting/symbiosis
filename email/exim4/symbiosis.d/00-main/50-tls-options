# If Exim is compiled with support for TLS, you may want to enable the

# authenticators will only work if the following TLS settings are turned on
# as well.

# Allow any client to use TLS.

# port. See RFC 4409 for details. Microsoft MUAs cannot be configured to

# them you should also allow TLS-on-connect on the traditional but
